# filepetter

An "FTP" client and server.

My first real C application, it's been through countless unfinished iterations.

It's pretty much done at this point.

What it's missing:

User input (being able to select a file to be transferred)
Output (just so users know what's happening)
Compatibility with non plain text files (They're corrupted for some reason)
